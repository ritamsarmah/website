# FAQ

## Getting Started

<details>
<summary>How do I get started with Textify?</summary>
Textify allows you to extract text from images, videos, and PDFs on your computer. Here are some ways to use Textify's text detection functionality:

- Drag and drop a file to Textify's start window or dock icon
- Open a file from your computer within Textify
- Capture images and videos from your screen using macOS's Screenshot app. Drag and drop the thumbnail that appears in the bottom corner of your screen directly into Textify. The following keyboard shortcuts are useful ways to capture your screen:
  - ⇧ ⌘ 3: Save picture of entire screen
  - ⇧ ⌘ 4: Save picture of a selected area
  - ⇧ ⌘ 5: Open Screenshot with recording options

Textify also includes a Safari extension that allows you to copy text from web images by right-clicking on them.

<summary>Which macOS versions and languages are supported by Textify?</summary>
Textify uses Apple's Vision framework included with macOS, which runs completely offline and locally on your computer. As a result, official language support is determined by your macOS version. Here are the currently supported versions and languages:

- **macOS Catalina 10.15:** English
- **macOS Big Sur 11.0:** English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)

Text extraction will work for some unsupported languages, as long as they have characters similar to an officially supported language; however, the transcription might be less accurate, and certain features like spelling correction won't work properly.

<summary>How do I use Textify's Safari extension?</summary>
Check that Textify is enabled in Safari's extension preferences. Once it is enabled, you can right-click on any image in a webpage and select "Copy Image Text". The image's text will be copied to your clipboard. You can also view the detected text by clicking on the Textify's toolbar button in Safari.

## Troubleshooting Issues

<details>
<summary>Why isn't Textify's Safari extension enabled/working for me?</summary>
<ol>
  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to "Textify" is checked.
  <li>If Textify is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Textify.</li>
  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>
  <li>If you continue to have issues, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@ritam.me">email me</a>.</li>
</ol>

<summary>Why does the transcribed text sometimes have inaccuracies?</summary>
 While optical character recognition technology has advanced a long way since its inception, it still can make mistakes. Text recognition works best on media with clear, high-resolution, uniform text. Handwritten, misshappened, or noisy text, and low resolution files can increase the likelihood of errors in the transcript.
