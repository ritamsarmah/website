# FAQ

<details>
<summary>Which websites work with Accelerate?</summary>
Accelerate works on any website using HTML5 video, which includes most modern sites like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, and Facebook. Accelerate does not support Flash video.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't I use right-click controls on Netflix or some other site?</summary>
Netflix and certain other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are some Safari extensions that can prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix or some other site?</summary>
The site is probably using a custom video player that modifies the standard playback control behavior. For example, the Netflix video player will sometimes freeze when using Accelerate's forward and backward skipping. As a result, your own playback keyboard shortcuts might not work perfectly, and you'll just have to use theirs.

<details>
<summary>Why aren't my updated keyboard controls or preferences working?</summary>
After you make changes to Accelerate's preferences, refresh any currently open websites to see the updates. If the changes still aren't showing, try restarting Safari.

<summary>Why isn't Accelerate enabled/working for me?</summary>
<ol>
  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to "Accelerate" is checked.
  <li>If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate.</li>
  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>
