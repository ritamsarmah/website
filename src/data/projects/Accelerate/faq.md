# FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I get started with Accelerate?</summary>
Accelerate allows you to control video playback primarily using keyboard shortcuts. The default controls are:

- **D**: Speed up
- **S**: Slow down
- **R**: Reset to default speed
- **A**: Toggle to your preferred speed
- **V**: Show current playback speed

These shortcuts can be modified in Accelerate's preferences, where you can create additional shortcuts to play/pause, skip forward/backward, and skip to the end of the video (e.g., for skipping ads). You can also right-click on a video to adjust playback speed or use the toolbar item to toggle to your preferred speed.

<summary>How do I configure preferences in Accelerate?</summary>
You can access Accelerate's preferences by opening the Accelerate application, say from Launchpad or Spotlight. Here are some options configurable under the General tab:

- The **default speed** to automatically start playing videos. Videos normally play at 1x speed by default.
- The **preferred speed** to toggle to after pressing the keyboard shortcut, toolbar item, or right-click menu option.
- The **speed interval** to change by when speeding up or slowing down playback.
- The **skip interval** (in seconds) to change by when skipping forward or skipping back.

After making changes to your preferences, refresh any currently open webpages to update.

<summary>How do I configure shortcuts in Accelerate?</summary>
Open up Accelerate's preferences and switch to the Shortcuts tab. Here you can configure two kinds of shortcuts to trigger each control option:

- **Single-key shortcuts**, which require a single key press on the keyboard. Configure by typing in the textfield directly to the right of each option.
- **Modifier-key shortcuts**, which require pressing a combination of regular and modifier keys, like command (⌘) or control (⌃). Configure by clicking "Record Shortcut" to the right of the textfields.

After making changes to your shortcuts, refresh any currently open webpages to update.

<summary>Which websites work with Accelerate?</summary>
Accelerate works on any website using HTML5 video, which includes most modern sites like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, and Facebook. Accelerate does not support Flash video.

<details>
<summary>Why can't I use right-click controls on Netflix or some other site?</summary>
Netflix and certain other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are some Safari extensions that can prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix or some other site?</summary>
The site is probably using a custom video player that modifies the standard playback control behavior. For example, the Netflix video player will sometimes freeze when using Accelerate's forward and backward skipping. As a result, your own playback keyboard shortcuts might not work perfectly, and you'll just have to use theirs.

<summary>Why aren't my updated keyboard shortcuts or preferences working?</summary>
After you make changes to any of Accelerate's preferences, refresh any currently open websites to see the updates. If the changes still aren't showing, try restarting Safari.

<summary>Why isn't Accelerate enabled/working for me?</summary>
<ol>
  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to "Accelerate" is checked.
  <li>If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate.</li>
  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>
  <li>If you continue to have issues, feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@ritam.me">email me</a>.</li>
