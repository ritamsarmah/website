# Frequently Asked Questions

## Which websites work with Accelerate?

Accelerate works on any website using HTML5 video, which includes most modern sites like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, and Facebook. Accelerate does not support Flash video.

## Why can't I use right-click controls on Netflix or some other site?

Netflix and certain other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are some Safari extensions that can prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.

## Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix or some other site?

The site is probably using a custom video player that modifies the standard playback control behavior. For example, the Netflix video player will sometimes freeze when using Accelerate's forward and backward skipping. As a result, your own playback keyboard shortcuts might not work perfectly, and you'll just have to use theirs.

## Why aren't my updated keyboard controls or preferences working?

After you make changes to Accelerate's preferences, you will have to refresh any currently open websites to see the updates. If the changes still aren't showing, try restarting Safari.

## Why isn't Accelerate enabled/working for me?

Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions; make sure the checkbox next to "Accelerate" is checked. If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate. If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.
