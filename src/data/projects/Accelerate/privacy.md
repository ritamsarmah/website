# Privacy Policy

#### Does Accelerate collect any of my data?

Accelerate never collects any personal data or identifiable information from you.

#### Why does Safari warn me that Accelerate can read sensitive info from all webpages?

This is a general warning for extensions requiring special permissions in Safari. In order to let you control video playback on any website, Accelerate runs some extra code that checks for videos on each page you visit. Apple rightfully cautions the user in case a malicious extension tries to abuse this permission; however, Accelerate never attempts to read any sensitive info from a webpage, and does not need to collect any data to function.

#### What if I have more questions about privacy?

If you have any additional questions about Accelerate and its privacy policy, feel free to contact the developer via [email](mailto:hello@ritam).
