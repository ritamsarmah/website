# Privacy Policy

#### Does Accelerate collect any of my data?

Accelerate never collects any personal data or identifiable information from you.

#### Why does Safari warn me that Accelerate can read sensitive info from all webpages?

This is a general warning shown by Apple for any extensions to load JavaScript into web pages, which includes pretty much all Safari extensions out there. In order to let you control video playback on any website, Accelerate runs some JavaScript code that finds videos on each page you visit. Apple rightfully cautions the user in case a malicious extension tries to abuse this permission; however, Accelerate never attempts to read any sensitive info from a webpage, and does not need to collect any data to function. If you're interested in a more detailed explanation of this warning, I recommend checking out this [blog post](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/security-safari-extensions.html).

#### What if I have more questions about privacy?

If you have any additional questions about Accelerate and its privacy policy, feel free to contact the developer via [email](mailto:hello@ritam).
